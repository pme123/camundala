  summary: "\n\nCreated at 12/01/2023, 18:17\n\n**[Check Project on Cawemo](https://cawemo.com/folders/a76e4b8e-8631-4d20-a8eb-258b000ff88a--camundala)**\n\
    \n> This is the invoice demo application which is shipped with the full distributions\
    \ in Camunda 7.\n\nSee the original [README](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform/tree/master/examples/invoice).\n\
    \nI bundled it here! Just run `InvoiceProcessApplication`.\n\n> This requires\
    \ that **Camunda 8 Standalone** is running -> _https://github.com/camunda/camunda-platform.git_\n\
    \nThis based on this Project: https://github.com/pme123/spring-boot-datakurre-plugins\n\
    \n## Migration BPMN/DMN to Camunda 8\n### Pain Points\n- The Migration Plugin\
    \ did not work for DMNs - I had to adjust the XML manually.\n- Forms can not be\
    \ linked (copy-paste Json of form) (Standalone version).\n- Camunda Property Infos\
    \ Plugin does not work.\n- FEEL is missing _**not** myProperty_ - you need to\
    \ do it _myProperty = false_.\n- CallActivities Input-Mapping were not migrated.\n\
    \n### What did not work\n- Forms in the Start Event\n  - Workaround: Added another\
    \ UserTask \n  - but with this, it is impossible to have Camunda Processes running\
    \ by itself (no other application must be deployed)\n- No files\n  - Workaround:\
    \ only the reference to the file is in the process.\n- Dynamic content in Form\
    \ Texts (FEEL)\n- Datastore / Data object reference have no graphic anymore\n\n\
    ### Cool stuff\n- Some code completion in FEEL expressions\n- Links in the Modeller\
    \ to the documentation\n\n## Migrating Camundala to Camunda 8\nThe work to migrate\
    \ the Example concerning:\n- API Documentation\n- Test Simulation\n- Validation\n\
    \n### API Documentation\nNothing to do here - the API stays the same! \U0001f389\
    \U0001f389\U0001f389\n### Test Simulation\n\n\n\n# Changelog\n\n<details>\n<summary>CHANGELOG.md</summary>\n\
