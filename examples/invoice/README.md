# The Camunda Invoice example in a Spring Boot Web Application
> This is the invoice demo application which is shipped with the full distributions.

See the original [README](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform/tree/master/examples/invoice).

I bundled it here! Just run `InvoiceServletProcessApplication`.

This based on this Project: https://github.com/pme123/spring-boot-datakurre-plugins
