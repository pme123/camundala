# Process & Domain Specification
First we define our Business Processes and -Domain.

## Process
Here we use the [BPMN Specification] with some extensions from [Camunda]. 
You can use [Camunda]'s tools to create them, see [Camunda Modeler](https://camunda.com/de/platform/modeler/).

To get started we will take the Invoice Example. 
You find a version for a version for _Camunda 7_ and one for _Camunda 8_ on Github - see [Invoice Example](https://github.com/pme123/camundala/tree/master/examples/invoice)

[Camunda 7 BPMN](https://github.com/pme123/camundala/blob/master/examples/invoice/camunda7/src/main/resources/invoice.v2.bpmn)

Nothing interesting here, just a standard Camunda/ BPMN Model. 
Let's define the Domain for this process.

## Domain
Whenever we interact with the _Process_, der are _Business Objects_ involved.
But also a Service that we integrate defines its _Domain_.

So implementing a Process is more or less working with Domain Objects, 
mostly mapping them to similar Domain Object, defined by Services.

To describe the _Domain Model_, we use basic _Scala_ constructs, like _Case Classes_ and _Enumerations_.

The following _BPMN Inputs / -Outputs_ do we describe:

* Process
* UserTask
* ReceiveSignal / ReceiveMessage (no Outputs)
* DMN

Here is the _UserTask_ 'Approve Invoice' from our _Invoice Process_.

* Import:
  ```scala
  import camundala.domain.*
  ```
* Input:
    ```scala
    @description("Received Invoice that need approval.")
    case class InvoiceReceipt(
      creditor: String = "Great Pizza for Everyone Inc.",
      amount: Double = 300.0,
      invoiceCategory: InvoiceCategory = InvoiceCategory.`Travel Expenses`,
      invoiceNumber: String = "I-12345",
      invoiceDocument: FileRefInOut = FileRefInOut(
        "invoice.pdf",
        "processes/invoice.pdf",
        Some("application/pdf")
      )
    )

    enum InvoiceCategory derives Adt.PureEncoder, Adt.PureDecoder:
      case `Travel Expenses`, Misc, `Software License Costs`
    
    ```
* Output:
    ```scala
    @description("""Every Invoice has to be accepted by the Boss.""")
    case class ApproveInvoice(
       @description("If true, the Boss accepted the Invoice")
       approved: Boolean = true
    )
    
    ```

You see here the following elements:

* `@description("my descr")` Description of a class or a field > used then in the API Documentation.
* `creditor: String = "Great Pizza for Everyone Inc."` Define each field with a name, a type and an example.
  You can use:

    * simple types, like _String_, _Boolean_ etc.
    * enumerations - like `InvoiceCategory`
    * objects - just other _Case Classes_
* `invoiceDocument: FileRefInOut` in _Camunda 8_ only JSONs are allowed - so you need a File representation.
* `enum InvoiceCategory..` this is how you define an enumeration. `..derives Adt.PureEncoder, Adt.PureDecoder..` is for JSON marshalling.
* `` `Travel Expenses`, `` if you have names with spaces you need to use Back-Ticks.

Checkout the whole Domain Description on [**Github**](https://github.com/pme123/camundala/blob/develop/examples/invoice/camunda8/src/main/scala/camundala/examples/invoice/domain.scala).

There are 2 things you have to care for that is not purely your domain.

### 1. Documentation
The closer the documentation is to your code, that you work with, the higher is the chance that you will spot mistakes.
So we use `@description("my descr")` from _[Tapir](https://tapir.softwaremill.com/en/latest/index.html)_. 
These descriptions will then automatically taken into account when the API documentation is generated.

### 2. JSON marshalling

@:callout(info)
We need this to get to and from JSON.
There is an automatic way, but it turned out that it made compiling slow.

Sorry for this technical noise ðŸ˜¥.
@:@

* Case Classes:
  ```scala
  given Schema[InvoiceReceipt] = Schema.derived
  given Encoder[InvoiceReceipt] = deriveEncoder
  given Decoder[InvoiceReceipt] = deriveDecoder
 ```

* Enumeration:
  ```scala
  // ..derives Adt.PureEncoder, Adt.PureDecoder is needed for JSON marshalling
  enum InvoiceCategory derives Adt.PureEncoder, Adt.PureDecoder:
      case `Travel Expenses`, Misc, `Software License Costs`

  given Schema[InvoiceCategory] = Schema.derived
  ```
