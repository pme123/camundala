# Intro

@:callout()
_The main goal of **Camundala** is to use your **Domain** as much as possible in your **Process Automation**._

_Define the **Domain** and let **Camundala** do most of the rest._

## Why the Focus on the Domain?
### Common Language
_What have Users, Business Analysts and Developers in common?_

Right, they should know the Domain that they are using or providingðŸ˜‰.

To have a common domain prevents that each team has its own domain model and speaks a (slightly) different language.

### Vendor Independent
The Domain Model is specific to a Company and should not be coupled to a Software vendor 
or a BPMN-Provider in this case.

### Specifies the Process
A _Process_, but also for example a _User Task_, can be described via its inputs and outputs, 
which must of course reflect your _Domain_.

So from the outside all you need to know, is **_how_** to interact with your process. 
And this _**how**_ can we describe perfectly with domain objects. 

### Reusable
If for example you provide the domain objects for your processes, everyone can reuse them, 
when interacting with your processes or developing processes in the same domain.
