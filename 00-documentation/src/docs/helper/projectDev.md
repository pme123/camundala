# Project Development
**Experimental**

The following chapters describe the tasks to support the project development.

## update
Whenever you have changes in the `company-camundala` project or in one of your dependencies, 
you can update the project with the following command:

```bash
./helper.scala update
```

This will create or update your project with the latest changes.

Files that contain the `DO NOT ADJUST` comment will be replaced.
If you do adjust them, remove this comment. 
You will get a warning, but the file will not be replaced.
